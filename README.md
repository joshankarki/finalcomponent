# component3
<h1>READ Carefully:</h1>

Component 3 extends on the previous exercises and you are required to now remove the json file and replace with models and a database. You will also have to add authentication and allow for a differentiation in customer and admin type roles. You can make the choice of whether to keep Blade based templates as used in Component 2 or move to an API type scenario and respond directly with json formatted data to Vue driven clients. 

<h2>Basic Requirements/Evidences list for component 3:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(Laravel) Models, Views & Controllers</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Authentication / Users</li>
  <li>Views (Blade and/or Vue)</li>
  <li>Version Control and Professional Practice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extension Requirements:</h2>
In the final application you are required to extend the application and update it based on the following supplied set of criterias:

- models and migrations (removing the earlier use of the json file)
- factories/seeders (for seeding large data sets)
- routing (named routes)
- views (blade or Vue )
- responsive UI/UX
- controllers (Resource Controllers/ User defined Controllers)
- authentication
- password reset
- authorization (using Gate or authorize)
- eloquent ORM

<h2>Extra Features:</h2>
As an effort to gain excellent marks you may choose to extend the features/functionality of your final project beyond what is asked in the above requirements. You may include any number of features such as - Dual Step Verfication, Mailables/Notifications, Paginations, Payment Gateways, Many to Many relationship, Multiple User Roles, etc. 

<h2>VIDEO DEMONSTRATION</h2>
This will be supported with a recorded video presentation where you will discuss your
findings on using Laravel as framework for developing web applications.
<ul>
  <li>The video demonstration should be approx 2 minutes. (max 3minutes). </li>
  <li>This should be a walkthrough of your application showing implemented functionality using English language for narration.</li> 
  <li>There is no need to go into details on how it works - this will be left for a QA to support your
    submission.</li>
  <li>The video should be submitted to YouTube with a link uploaded to MyBeckett. Make sure to keep the video's visibility as public when you upload.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
Prepare a brief documentation of your project as a .docx or .pdf file. Here you should simply have a short paragraph and a bullet list of the feautures of your application. And include  a few (3-5)screenshots of your project that highlights your work on UI/UX.

<h2>PROJECT SUBMISSION:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Commit project files in the github repository including the video demo file and documentation file.</li>
  <li>IN Blackboard/MyBeckket:
    <ul>
      <li>Your component 3 remote Git Repository link posted to MyBeckett</li>
      <li>Your Youtube Video Link for Component 3 Demo Video</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>VIVA</h2>
To support your submission you are required to do a QA with module staff. This is where
your knowledge of good practice in development of web applications will be examined.
Failure to attend a presentation will result in a mark capped at 40% for this component and
this will be arrived at from the video submission and the associated code files on GitHub.
<i>You will be informed of the VIVA date, time and instruction via Orbund</i>

<h2>All the best.</h2>
